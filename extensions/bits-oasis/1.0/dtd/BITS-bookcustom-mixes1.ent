                        Inline elements appear only inside a
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes

                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only
                        inside a paragraph,  some incoming material
                        will have restricted them to only outside a
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->

                        MAINTENANCE NOTE: This Parameter Entity
                        and the related PE "just-rendition" have
                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to individually change similar models.
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to change similar models individually .    -->

                        Simple text plus inline display and math

                        that are really expected to be #PCDATA and
                        not to contain any of these things.
                        As first defined, this element contained
                        no math and no links, thus is was even
                        simpler than %simple-phrase; in this version
                        the two are the same.                      -->
